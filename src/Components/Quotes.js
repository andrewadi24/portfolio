                    <h2>Andrew has been an excellent leader for the Capstone group. He has led our meetings facilitating clear communication between the team members and me. Our project was a complete success. We ended up with a finished product that exceeded my expectations. Andrew showed high level dedication to the project and this rubbed off on the whole team (who were also excellent!). It has been a pleasure to work with Andrew. - Matthew Slades, Senior Lecturer at the University Of Sydney</h2>
